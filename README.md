# "Samsung" Live TV VLC(ActiveX) application
This is repository for my VisualBasic .net application, now based on ActiveX VLC plugin - expect changes

This application was made in 2 days from 1/2.Jan and idea come from 3 years before as i was trying to make online tv application but and it wasn't working. 

Needs VLC ActiveX plugin(for now, preparing to switch to other lib.)

Includes very basic "OSD"

Has older Chrome(Awesomium) browser included.

Made on "lame" programming language VisualBasic .net as you saw it up

#Uses public found ip adresses with Slovak and Czech TV(some could not work)
#Screenshots(that *magenta* around is caused by magic wand and AntiAliasing):
